# ðŸ‘º Context-Sensitive Emotion Detection in Bangla Text using Deep Learning

Emotion identification from textual data is becoming an increasingly relevant study, particularly as social media and other Web 2.0 platforms allow people to communicate a wide spectrum of emotions. Despite tremendous advances in high-resource languages such as English, emotion recognition in low-resource languages, notably Bangla, remains an unexplored subject. Combining the two publicly available datasets of UBMEC and Bengali_Banglish. We (i) examine the effectiveness of the baseline and ensemble approach for emotion detection. (ii) We presented a benchmark strategy and robustness of emotion identification in Bengali texts. (iii) Identifying difficulties and answers to identifying emotions in writing. The experiment found that the hyperparameter tuning of the CNN+LSTM had a maximum accuracy of 57% on the test data. Also, offers observations and issues that demonstrate the complexities of emotion categorization.
